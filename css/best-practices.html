        The DRY principle and other best practices. 
      </p>

      <h2>Using Multiple Selectors</h2>
      <p>Say I have four levels of headings in my document, and I want to make sure they all use the same font family. I could write the following style rules:</p>
<pre>
  h1 {
    font-family:  "New Century Schoolbook", "Times New Roman", serif;
  }
  h2 {
    font-family:  "New Century Schoolbook", "Times New Roman", serif;
  }
  h3 {
    font-family:  "New Century Schoolbook", "Times New Roman", serif;
  }
  h3 {
    font-family:  "New Century Schoolbook", "Times New Roman", serif;
  }
</pre>
      <p>There's nothing technically wrong with these rules: they'll display just fine in the browser. The problem is that this violates a core principle in
        programming: <strong>DRY</strong>. It stands for "Don't Repeat Yourself" and is a reminder to re-use code and logic whenever possible (or: whenever it makes)
        sense to do so). You apply the DRY principle in CSS. If there are  style rules that you'd like to apply to many elements, all you need to do is separate them with
        commas in the CSS rules. Here's how we can make the above code DRY-compliant:</p>
<pre>
  h1, h2, h3, h4 {
    font-family:  "New Century Schoolbook", "Times New Roman", serif;
  }
</pre>
      <p>The obvious advantage here is that you only need to change one line if you decide to use a different font. Another is that the code is much more readable;
      you can easily see that all of your headings are grouped into one line and add more rules as needed</p>

      <h2>Start with the generics, then get specific</h2>

      <p>List all of your general rules first, then add any specific instances later. This will keep one rule from getting accidentally overwritten by another.
        Here's an example:</p>
<pre>
   &lt;h1&gt;All about me&lt;/h1&gt;
     &lt;p class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;My life story: it's a fascinating tale...&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;The early years...&lt;/p&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;The current years...&lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

      <p>The following rules show the specific class of "intro" being displayed <em>before</em> the generic <code>p</code> tag rules.</p>
<pre>
p.intro {
      font-size: 20px;
      font-family:fantasy;
      color: #5D3706;
}
p {
      font-size: 16px;
      font-family: monospace;
      color: #111111;
}
</pre>
      <p>This would display perfectly fine in the browser due to the rule of <strong>specificity</strong> in CSS. This means that although it appears as if
      the generic <code>p</code> rule should override the <code>p.intro</code> rule when displaying that first paragraph, it won't because the addition
      of a class name is more specific than a generic element.</p>
      <div class="codeExample" id="group">
         <h1>All about me</h1>
           <p class="intro">My life story: it's a fascinating tale...</p>
           <p>The early years...</p>
           <p>The current years...</p>
      </div>
      <p>Still, it makes more sense to have your generic CSS rules grouped together, then more-specific rules.</p>
<pre>
p {
      font-size: 16px;
      font-family: monospace;
      color: #111111;
}
p.intro {
      font-size: 20px;
      font-family:fantasy;
      color: #5D3706;
}
</pre>
