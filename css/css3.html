      <p class="lead">The CSS3 specification is still being defined as of 2012, but here are some examples to wet your whistle.</p>

      <p>Most browsers already support many of the new CSS3 specifications in their latest versions, and almost all smartphones do. But since not all browsers
      support these items, it's best to use them to <strong>enhance</strong> the user's experience on your site. Don't depend on CSS3 elements for the <strong>design</strong> or
      <strong>construction</strong> of your site; those using older browsers may become lost as style rules are applied sporadically or not at all.</p>

      <aside>
        Don't assume that people aren't using the latest versions of web browsers out of fear or apathy. Some may want to upgrade and aren't sure how to do it. Some people may be
        using the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy. And some people may be visiting your site from a computer they don't own and cannot upgrade (like a work or lab computer).
      </aside>

      <p>Here are a few of the new changes you can make in a browser with CSS3 rules. Note: the display examples will be images rather than CSS3 rules to ensure you will be able to view them,
      regardless of the browser you're using.</p>

      <aside>Not sure if browser you're using for this tutorial supports CSS3? You can find out in the "Css3 Support"
        section of the <a href="http://fmbip.com/">FindMeByIP</a> website.

      <h2>RGB Colors</h2>

      <p>We've been referring to colors in this chapter in hexidecimal (hex) format such as <code>#E01BAB</code>, which is a bright pink color. The hex format identifies the amount of red, green,
      and blue color to mix into a screen pixel. RGB color does the same thing using a different format: the hex color listed previous would be displayed as rgb(224, 27, 171). The advantage to using
      RGB colors with CSS3 rules is that you can also set a <strong>transparency level</strong> for the color, without changing the color value.</p>

      <p>Here are the style rules for a class of "box" that can be applied to an HTML5 element:</p>
<pre>
.box {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  float:left;
  margin: 10px;
  background-color: rgb(224,27,171);
                    <span class="exampleAside"><i class="icon-arrow-up"></i> CSS3 rule for color: RGB</span>
}
</pre>

      <p>This is a screenshot of what would be displayed in the browser:</p>

      <img src="/assets/img/css3-rgb-boxes.png" alt="image of 5 boxes with the same dimensions and the same pink background color.">

      <p>Let's say you wanted to display these boxes as the same color, but with decreasing levels of transparency and ending with the solid color. Before CSS3 rules, you would have to
        determine what each new hex color would be. Now however, you can determine what your base color would be and apply an <strong>alpha transparency</strong> between 0 and 1 (with 1 being 100% 
        opaque) with the <code>RGBa</code> format. </p>

<pre>
<span class="exampleAside"><i class="icon-arrow-down"></i> Create a separate class for each level of transparency</span>
.alpha20 {
  background-color: rgba(224,27,171,0.2);
}
.alpha40 {
  background-color: rgba(224,27,171,0.4);
}
.alpha60 {
  background-color: rgba(224,27,171,0.6);
}
.alpha80 {
  background-color: rgba(224,27,171,<span class="exampleAside">0.8</span>);
                    <span class="exampleAside"><i class="icon-arrow-up"></i> The RGBa property and transparency value</span>
}
</pre>
      <p>Add the new classes to your elements:</p>
<pre>
&lt;div class=&quot;box alpha20&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box alpha40&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box alpha60&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box alpha80&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

      <p>And now you have your graduated colors. No images have to be captured, and these can be easily modified later if you want to change the color.</p>

      <img src="/assets/img/css3-rgba-boxes.png" alt="image of 5 boxes with graduated colors, starting with light and increasing to deep pink.">
