      <p class="lead">The CSS3 specification is still being defined as of 2012, but here are some examples to wet your whistle.</p>

      <p>Most browsers already support many of the new CSS3 specifications in their latest versions, and almost all smartphones do. But since not all browsers
      support these items, it's best to use them to <strong>enhance</strong> the user's experience on your site. Don't depend on CSS3 elements for the <strong>design</strong> or
      <strong>construction</strong> of your site; those using older browsers may become lost as style rules are applied sporadically or not at all.</p>
