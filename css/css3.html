      <p class="lead">The CSS3 specification is still being defined as of 2012, but here are some examples to wet your whistle.</p>

      <p>Most browsers already support many of the new CSS3 specifications in their latest versions, and almost all smartphones do. But since not all browsers
      support these items, it's best to use them to <strong>enhance</strong> the user's experience on your site. Don't depend on CSS3 elements for the <strong>design</strong> or
      <strong>construction</strong> of your site; those using older browsers may become lost as style rules are applied sporadically or not at all.</p>

      <aside>
        Don't assume that people aren't using the latest versions of web browsers out of fear or apathy. Some may want to upgrade and aren't sure how to do it. Some people may be
        using the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" philosophy. And some people may be visiting your site from a computer they don't own and cannot upgrade (like a work or lab computer).
