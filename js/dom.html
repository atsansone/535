        Why did we have to learn all of that nested object stuff? Well,
        the next thing we are going to learn about is the
        <em>Document Object Model</em>. Notice that second word? Understanding
        objects is going to make this next part go a lot more smoothly.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the last section, we created a series of nested objects.
        We created a car object. Inside of that object was a driver
        object. A car might also have a passenger object. We can visualize
        this object hierarchy like this:
        </p>

        <p>
        [TODO: Insert Figure here.]
        </p>

        <p>
        When we graph out this object hierarchy, we get a graph that we
        call a <em>tree</em>. We call each object in the tree a <em>node</em>,
        and we can describe different relationships between nodes. At the
        <em>root</em> of our tree is the car object. The driver object
        is a <em>child</em> of car, because it is directly below it
        in the object hierarchy. We can also describe car then as driver's
        <em>parent</em>. What we're establishing here is a <em>model</em> --
        we are creating a way to describe the relationships between different
        the car object and its various properties. You might say we are
        establishing a <em>Car Object Model</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
        When we use JavaScript in an HTML document to manipulate that document,
        we use the <em>Document Object Model</em>. When your web browser loads
        an HTML page, it constructs a model for that page very similar to the
        model we just made up. For example, say you have a simple HTML that
        looks like this:

        <br />
        <pre>
        <code>
        TODO: Put example here.
        </code>
        </pre>
        <br />

        Like with our car object, we can imagine this HTML document as a set
        of object nodes:
        <br /><br />
        TODO: Put figure here
        <br /><br />
        </p>

        <p>
        The Document Object Model, or DOM, is very similar to the object model
        we came up with earlier, except the object nodes correspond to HTML
        elements. At the root of our model we have the <em>document</em> node.
        The descendents of the document node are the various HTML elements
        in the document in the same hierarchical structure as they appear in the
        HTML file.
