        Why did we have to learn all of that nested object stuff? Well,
        the next thing we are going to learn about is the
        <em>Document Object Model</em>. Notice that second word? Understanding
        objects is going to make this next part go a lot more smoothly.
        </p>

        <p>
        In the last section, we created a series of nested objects.
        We created a car object. Inside of that object was a driver
        object. A car might also have a passenger object. We can visualize
        this object hierarchy like this:
        </p>

        <p>
        [TODO: Insert Figure here.]
        </p>

        <p>
        When we graph out this object hierarchy, we get a graph that we
        call a <em>tree</em>. We call each object in the tree a <em>node</em>,
        and we can describe different relationships between nodes. At the
        <em>root</em> of our tree is the car object. The driver object
        is a <em>child</em> of car, because it is directly below it
        in the object hierarchy. We can also describe car then as driver's
        <em>parent</em>. What we're establishing here is a <em>model</em> --
        we are creating a way to describe the relationships between different
        the car object and its various properties. You might say we are
        establishing a <em>Car Object Model</em>.
