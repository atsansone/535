      <h1>An introduction to JavaScript</h1>
      <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>

      <p>
      To get an idea of what JavaScript is, it's useful to think of some
      of the things we can do with it.
      <ul>
        <li>When Google tries to guess what you're typing in its search box
        and displays different possibilities, that's JavaScript.</li>
        <li>When you're signing up for a new account on a website, and it
        tells you in real time as you type your password if it's strong enough,
        that's JavaScript.</li>
        <li>When you you click on an item on a menu, and it expands
        to show you more options, that's JavaScript.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>
      What do these things have in common? They all have to do the
      <em>behavior</em> of a webpage. JavaScript is a programming language
      that is implemented in all modern web browsers that let us write
      programs to allow for greater interactivity on a webpage. While
      HTML lets you define the content of a page, and CSS lets you define
      what that content looks like, JavaScript lets you define how it behaves
      and how it should interact with whoever is looking at it.
      </p>

      <p>
      Learning the basics of JavaScript will allow you to add this kind
      of behavior to your web content. In addition to letting you make
      more interesting webpages, JavaScript is a great programming language
      to learn because of its ubiquity. As mentioned before, almost all
      modern web browsers include a JavaScript interpreter, so knowing JavaScript
      lets you write scripts that can run on almost any platform.
      </p>

      <h2>A history of JavaScript</h2>

      <p>
      It is useful to know a few things about the history of JavaScript, to
      get familiar with some of the terms you'll hear as you read more about it.
      </p>

      <p>
      JavaScript was invented by a guy named Brendan Eich for Netscape
      back in the 1990's. Netscape was the maker of a web browser, so at
      that time, they made a competitor product to Microsoft's Internet
      Explorer. It was originally called <em>Mocha</em> and <em>LiveScript</em>,
      and the name JavaScript was finally chosen mostly for marketing reasons,
      since the Java programming language was becoming popular at that time.
      </p>

      <p>
      Microsoft wanted to be able to support similar functionality in Internet
      Explorer, so they added a language called <em>JScript</em> to their
      browser. JScript was similar to JavaScript, but not necessarily completely
      compatible. By the mid 90's, it was clear that having a scripting language
      in the browser was important, but that it would be too much of a hassle
      to have to support different implementations in different browsers. So
      a standard was written for the language. The standards body resposnible
      for this standard is called ECMA, so the standard for the language is
      called ECMAScript.
      </p>

      <p>
      So, what can we learn from this history?
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript has almost nothing to do with Java, besides sharing a name.
        So if you don't know Java, don't think you're behind in learning JavaScript.
        If you do know Java, you might be a little more comfortable reading some JavaScript,
        but you shouldn't assume things work the same -- these are two different languages.</li>
        <li>There is a standard for JavaScript, but each browser still has their own
        JavaScript engine that implements that standard. Mozilla's JavaScript engine is
        called SpiderMoney. Google's JavaScript engine is called V8. This shouldn't matter
        for this tutorial, but if you run into these names when you are reading about JavaScript,
        they just refer to different browsers.</li>
        <li>Although there is a standard, certain browsers might not follow the standard
        completely. Everything we'll do in this tutorial should work in all modern web
        browsers, and for the most part, most JavaScript scripts that follow the standard
        should also work. But it is worth keeping in mind that there are still differences
        between browsers, so as you read more about JavaScript on the web, you might notice
        some people being annoyed with with these differences.</li>
        <li>ECMAScript refers to the standard, and JavaScript refers to browsers'
        implementation of that standard. The latest edition of ECMAScript is 5.1,
        and most modern web browsers will support that standard. We won't be doing
        anything too fancy that was introduced in the newest version, but it's important
        to know that if you're interested in the direction that JavaScript is heading,
        you should see what proposals are being made for the next version of ECMAScript.</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <h2>What's next?</h2>
      <p>
      Now that you have an idea of what you can do with JavaScript and
      know a little bit about it's history, we're ready to dive in. In
      the next section, we'll figure out how to access your web browser's
      JavaScript console. That will let us learn more about JavaScript
      in an interactive environment. You'll type in some commands to
      the console to add some interactive features to this web page,
      and in the sections that follow we'll examine more in depth
      what those things were that you typed in, and in the process
      learn more about JavaScript the language and how it relates to
      something called the DOM. Finally, after getting an idea
      on some of the language features of JavaScript and how to do
      DOM scripting, we'll take a look at jQuery, a popular JavaScript
      framework that simplifies common tasks in JavaScript.

        <h1>Accessing a JavaScript REPL </h1>
        <p>
          Most current web browsers ship with a modern Javascript engine
          and access to it via a developer console. (I think this is the
          case for MSIE, Firefox, Chrome, and possibly Safari, although
          some work might be necessary to enable it in all of these.)
          This section will give a quick tour on how to get up and running
          in a JavaScript REPL, how they work, etc. My thinking is
          that if we do this first, the rest of the sections can
          be done interactively using the console.
        </p>
        <p>
        The goal of this section will just be able to <code>alert("Hello, World!")</code>
        (or something more creative.) This gives a very visual indication
        that they can do something.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>
        Here is a button:
        </p>

        <button type="button" class="btn" id="color-change-button">Change background color</button>

        <p>
        If you tried clicking on it, you'll notice that nothing
        happened. That's because it hasn't actually been programmed to do
        anything. But that's about to change! Fire up your browser's
        JavaScript console, and you're going to make that button do what
        it says.
        </p>

        <p>
        Type the following into the console:
        </p>

        <pre>
        <code>
          var btn = document.getElementById("color-change-button");

          btn.onclick = buttonClickHandler;

          function buttonClickHandler() {
            var randomColor = getRandomColor();
            document.body.style.background = randomColor;
          }
        </code>
        </pre>

        <p>
        Try clicking the button again. You should see a result.
        </p>
