        <h1>Accessing a JavaScript REPL </h1>
        <p>
          Most current web browsers ship with a modern Javascript engine
          and access to it via a developer console. (I think this is the
          case for MSIE, Firefox, Chrome, and possibly Safari, although
          some work might be necessary to enable it in all of these.)
          This section will give a quick tour on how to get up and running
          in a JavaScript REPL, how they work, etc. My thinking is
          that if we do this first, the rest of the sections can
          be done interactively using the console.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h1>Introduction to Programming Concepts</h1>
      <p>
        Topics here might include:
        <ul>
          <li>Variables</li>
          <li>Control flow. (Could talk about "truthiness" here, but
          probably isn't necessary for introduction.)</li>
          <li>Data types</li>
          <li>Functions</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the goal of the section would be the ability to
        "think" like a programmer -- to look at a problem and
        identify how you could use things like variables and
        functions to solve them. This isn't necessarily JS specific,
        and might be able to be pulled out so these topics
        could be referenced both in this section as well as the
        Ruby section. I'm still having a hard time knowing
        exactly how much detail we need to have here.
      </p>

      <section>
      <h1>The DOM</h1>
      <p>
      <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite> doesn't really begin
      mentioning web programming / the dom specificially until
      chapter 11/12. I think it should get introducd here
      earlier. My thinking is, we aren't necessary just trying
      to introduce JavaScript as a programming language, but
      rather introduce it within the context of web technologies
      and the role it plays on the web. So rather than focus on
      some of the other details <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite>
      does (object orientation, functional programming, etc.),
      it would be better to give the reader a basic understanding
      of programming and then jump into the DOM.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here again, I struggle with how much detail to go into.
      Chapter 3 of <cite>DOM Scripting</cite> might be a good
      basis though, I think, basically breaking down what the
      D, O, and M mean.
      </p>

      <h1>An Exercise</h1>
      <p>
      After an introduction to JavaScript and the DOM,
      <cite>DOM Scripting</cite> has a chapter that is
      basically an exercise in actually putting together
      a small JS app. I think it would be beneficial to
      do the same thing here, sort of as an extension
      of the last section. Also, up until now, I've been
      assuming that we've just been doing examples in
      the JS console, and this could be a chance to see
      how loading scripts on a page works, etc. We could
      create a template that includes all the HTML or
      something, and then just have them focus on filling
      out the js files.
      </p>
      <p>
      TODO: Figure out a good exercise. It shouldn't be
      something terribly complex, but it ideally touches
      on everything learned up to this point.
