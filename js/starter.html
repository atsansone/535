      <h1>An introduction to JavaScript</h1>
      <p>
      I want this section here to give people an idea of what JavaScript
      is and how learning it enables you to do cool stuff. I think this
      includes giving examples of some cool things out on the web that
      are powered by js. I also want to emphasize the ubiquity of js --
      it's powerful because every computer has a modern js interpreter on
      it.

        <h1>Accessing a JavaScript REPL </h1>
        <p>
          Most current web browsers ship with a modern Javascript engine
          and access to it via a developer console. (I think this is the
          case for MSIE, Firefox, Chrome, and possibly Safari, although
          some work might be necessary to enable it in all of these.)
          This section will give a quick tour on how to get up and running
          in a JavaScript REPL, how they work, etc. My thinking is
          that if we do this first, the rest of the sections can
          be done interactively using the console.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h1>Fundamentals</h1>
      <p>
      I was initially thinking I wanted to cover a bunch of programming
      constructs here, but I'm trying to reconsider what is actually necessary
      to do basic js scripts (do you really need to know what a for
      loop is?) I think it data types are still important, what a function
      call looks like.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h1>The DOM</h1>
      <p>
      <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite> doesn't really begin
      mentioning web programming / the dom specificially until
      chapter 11/12. I think it should get introducd here
      earlier. My thinking is, we aren't necessary just trying
      to introduce JavaScript as a programming language, but
      rather introduce it within the context of web technologies
      and the role it plays on the web. So rather than focus on
      some of the other details <cite>Eloquent JavaScript</cite>
      does (object orientation, functional programming, etc.),
      it would be better to give the reader a basic understanding
      of programming and then jump into the DOM.
      </p>

      <p>
      Here again, I struggle with how much detail to go into.
      Chapter 3 of <cite>DOM Scripting</cite> might be a good
      basis though, I think, basically breaking down what the
      D, O, and M mean.
      </p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h1>An Exercise</h1>
      <p>
      After an introduction to JavaScript and the DOM,
      <cite>DOM Scripting</cite> has a chapter that is
      basically an exercise in actually putting together
      a small JS app. I think it would be beneficial to
      do the same thing here, sort of as an extension
      of the last section. Also, up until now, I've been
      assuming that we've just been doing examples in
      the JS console, and this could be a chance to see
      how loading scripts on a page works, etc. We could
      create a template that includes all the HTML or
      something, and then just have them focus on filling
      out the js files.
      </p>
      <p>
      TODO: Figure out a good exercise. It shouldn't be
      something terribly complex, but it ideally touches
      on everything learned up to this point.
