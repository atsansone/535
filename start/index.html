          Three tools are essential to the work of modern web design &amp; development, and other
          source-level writing and design endeavors.
        </p>
        <h1>Web Browser</h1>
        <p>
          You might not think much about your web browser: it's just whatever came installed with
          your computer: Safari on Mac, or Internet Explorer on Windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          But you should add additional browsers to your computer. Two options are Mozilla Firefox
          and Google Chrome. Both Firefox and Chrome have a variety of add-ons available to them,
          which can make design and development easier. They also help you to separate your
          development work from your casual browsing, in case you already have another browser
          you prefer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most importantly, though, different browsers will show you firsthand that the web looks
          different to different users. Sometimes the differences are subtle; other times, the
          differences are major. And in all cases, your designs will have to work acceptably in
          all browsers.
        </p>
        <h2>Download Time</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Mozilla Firefox</li>
          <li>Google Chrome</li>
        </ul>
        <h1>Text Editor</h1>
        <p>
          As in "plain-text editor." A text editor, or simply "editor," edits plain text files. Not
          just <code>.txt</code> files, but <code>.html</code>, <code>.css</code>, <code>.js</code>
          and any other markup, scripting, or programming file that exists as plain text (and almost
          all of them do).
        </p>
        <p>
          If you're a Mac user, you might be familiar with TextEdit; similarly, Windows users may
          know the Notepad app. While both of those are plain-text editors, they don't have key
          features (most notably, syntax highlighting) that make them comfortable for the tasks
          of writing markup or scripting and programming.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mac users should download TextWrangler; Windows users should download Notepad++.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once you have your new editor installed, open it up and set the following preferences
          (you might want to Google for these if you get stuck):
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Use UTF-8 (Unicode) character encoding, without the Byte Order Mark (BOM), as the
            default for all files
          </li>
          <li>
            Use Unix-style line endings (LF, not CR or CR+LF)
          </li>
          <li>
            Use two spaces for the tab (set up your editor so that hitting tab inserts two spaces,
            as though you'd just hit the spacebar twice)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h1>Command Line</h1>
        <p>
          The command line...
