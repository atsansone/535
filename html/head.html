     <h3>!DOCTYPE html</h3>
     <p> The first element. First we see &lt;doctype HTML&gt;. 
This is essentially what makes a webpage a webpage. It’s what the browser reads to let it know that it should render the code. If you were to take a look at the [show how] HTML of various webpages, such as ..., and ..., this would be the very first thing you see. Go on, try it. There are variations of this based on the version of HTML the developer used when they built the page (but since we're learning the latest and greatest, we'll not go into that).
And, of course, without the doc tag, (as we’ll see below) it doesn’t read as a webpage, only as a bunch of text.

But that’s not it.  Remember when we talked about bookends? [introduce this here or before?] Let’s go all the way to the end of the sample code.  At the very end of the document we see &lt;/html&gt;.  This tag lets the browser know that the page is complete and there is nothing else to render. (it's possible)  Besides, it has enough to do with all of the juicy code we put between the brackets. So you’re probably wondering what would happen if we were to leave the end tag off. Well, that depends. Which browser are. Is this something you're really willing to risk? That would be the &lt;doctype html&gt; and the &lt;/html&gt;. Now lets get into the components of these tags. Pay attention here. This is basically what makes up html and we’ll see these over and over again. 
Like we just learned &lt;Doctype html&gt; is basically the tag that tells the browser that it is a webpage. And &lt;html&gt; is the tag that tells the browser to end it.
