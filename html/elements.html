<p>There is clearly a lot that went into such a simple looking document, but before we go on, let's define some terminology.</p>
    
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p> A tag is the simplest unit of HTML, which basically defines the language. The tags are what the browser reads to determine how to render the code into a webpage. A browser recognizes an HTML tag by the &lt; &gt; which encloses the particular instruction. Like bookends, the &lt; and &gt; lets the browser know when the tag begins (&lt;) and ends (&gt;). Let's take another look at the project code for an example.  On the second line, we see the <span class="prettyprint"> &lt;html&gt; </span> tag. The &lt;html&gt; lets the browser know that the what follows is a webpage. </p>
<p>But wait, there's more. Just as the tag needed to have both an &lt; and an &gt;, to define it as such, the element that the tag modifies needs it as well, which is defined by &lt;/&gt;. So think of each tag as a set of bookends, one at the beginning, also called a start tag, &lt; &gt; and one at the end, a closing or end tag &lt; / &gt;. [aside: some browsers allow for a looser format and may not require an ending tag but, best practices require both start and end tags] There are two exceptions to this "bookend" rule: one we discussed earlier - &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;which tells the browser which version of html it is using; and the second is &lt;/br&gt;, which we'll discuss in the "Structure and Layout" section.
</p>
<p>As we return to our example, we can see that the &lt;html&gt; start tag at the beginning, has a closing bookend tag, &lt;/html&gt; all the way at the very end of the page. In fact, it's the last tag, which makes sense because it is basically telling the browser that there is nothing more to the webpage.
</p>

<h3>Elements </h3>
<p> An element consists of a set of opening and closing tags and the information it encloses. For example, in the sample project, we see that there are more than one meta elements, which we will learning more about in the next section, each of which begin with the opening meta tag &lt;/meta&gt; has some information then end with the closing tag &lt;/meta&gt;. The tags by themselves &lt;meta&gt; and &lt;/meta&gt;are simply tags.</p>
<p> Sometimes you may see, the term element used interchangeably with tag. Let's take for example the element &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. It is an element that stands by itself.  Let's find another example. below that is &lt;html&gt;. but not simply &lt;html&gt;, it also includes the tag and value, <span class="prettyprint"> lang="en"</span> where the tag is lang and the value is en.</p>

<h3>Values</h3>
<p> You will get much more involved with values as you learn about CSS</p>

<p>Now that we have some of the definitions out of the way, let's move on to the next section and see how webpages are put together, beginning with <a href="head.html">the head</a>.</p>
