      <h3> Overview and the Basics </h3>
        <p>The World Wide Web, aka, WWW (yes, that’s what that means) has undergone many changes since it’s inception a few decades ago.  If you were indoctrinated into the web with HTML or XHTML, have no fear, your knowledge will not be considered obsolete.  If you have only heard rumors of such a thing called HTML, don’t worry, we’ll walk you through the basics. HTML5 is the latest iteration of markup language that makes webpages webpages. [For a fuller history of how HTML5 came to be, including what happened to versions 1,2,3, and 4, please visit ------ or wikipedia]. </p>
        <p> So, does that mean if I use HTML4, it wouldn’t work? 
Well, technically yes. Which is why we still see remnants of the nineties and its, shall we say, distinctly antiquated webpages emerge from the dark every now and then. If it didn’t work, then we couldn’t see it (and suffer).
<h4> Browsers</h4>
<p> Which brings us to the next point. How is that possible? It’s all made possible with this little thing we call browsers (yes, I know, web browsers). Some people never consider the how the information except by the question of whether or not they are connected (hello internet bills)  get to them, only that they do. All web browsers are free, so there is no cost to them except (in their experience). Most people don’t even bother or know they could use other browsers except for the ones that come with the software (Internet Explorer/Safari). But browsers.  Other browsers you  may have heard have.  [Which browser are you using now? Test page.]</p>
<p>If you look at the HTML for pages that were created 15 years, 15 months, or even 15 days ago, you will find a wide range of coding specifications running the gamut. (SIDEBAR: to view code of this page, select this) Yet it all works. A related question is why can’t you see the code when you go to a page? The browser you are using renders/translates the code into an attractive (hopefully) combination of images and text. In short, code only works if the browser can understand it. That’s because the code is only as powerful as the browser The HTML tells the browser what to display. How this is displayed (how attractive) is determined by another type of code. Yes, there’s more. So much more. [For more on how to make the what attractive, go on to the CSS section, after this one of course].  Basically, HTML5 is interesting than previous versions, that it allows for all previous iterations to exist. Which is where HTML5 comes in. </p>
<p>As you'll soon see, the language that makes up HTML.  Each browser. Not only browsers but browser versions. As browsers update to newer versions to keep up with changing security risks and to offer additional features, there are parts of the HTML language that they stop using or start using. This also means that each version may not support some features of various languages, including HTML.</p>
<p> aside: [So how well does the browser you're on render code? (aka how compliant is your browser with the latest version of HTML?) Visit here to find out.]</p>

      <h4>What Does HTML Actually Do?"</h4>
      <p> HTML provides the infrastructure, building blocks the content you want to display... </p>

<p>So, in short, with HTML you can:
<ul>
<li>Create infrastructure for your content</li>
<li> </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p> What you can't and/or shouldn't do with HTML:
<ul>
<li> Make things pretty</li>
<p> aside: There are a few exceptions (like html emails) but let's not get into those. Suffice to say that 95% of the time, you will be using HTML for the reasons above and not much beyond that.</p>

</ul>
</p>
      <p> Now that we've covered the basics, let move on to some actual coding. <a href = "section1.html">Next section</a> .</p>
