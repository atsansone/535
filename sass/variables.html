      <p class="lead">Here are some examples of why you'll want to get to know Sass:</p>

      <h2>Variables</h2>
      <p>This is usually where people get hooked on Sass: the ability assign variables to items. My favorite place to use them is when declaring
      colors in Hex or RGB mode: it's difficult to remember what #4C1BE0 means when you look through your CSS rules, and if you haven't been good about
      using comments, then you have to look it up manually.</p>

      <p>Here is an example of using variables for color in Sass. This is what the normal CSS that is generated by Sass would look like:</p>
<pre>
body {
  background: #89a194;
  padding: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
  color: #322938;
}
body a {
  color: #a14016;
  font-weight: 900;
}
</pre>

      <p>And here's how the Sass language makes that much more readable:</p>
<pre>
<span class="exampleAside">$backgroundColor</span>: #89A194;
<span class="exampleAside">$bodyFontColor</span>: #322938;
<span class="exampleAside">$linkColor1</span>: #A14016;

body {
  background: <span class="exampleAside">$backgroundColor;</span>
  padding: 20px 10px 10px 10px;
  color: <span class="exampleAside">$bodyFontColor;</span>
}
body a {
  color: <span class="exampleAside">$linkColor1;</span>
  font-weight: 900;
}
</pre>
