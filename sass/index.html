      <p class="lead">Sass is awesome. That is all.</p>

      <p>This section will not include specific learning objectives or a Test Your Knowledge section. To install Sass requires (if you're using
        a Windows machine) a significant addition to your operating system--Ruby. The <a href="/ruby">Ruby</a> chapter of this site allows you to
      get some practice from the command line, but Sass requires a full installation.</p>
      <p>You'll learn more about Sass in other courses, but here you can get an introduction to what it is, why it's awesome, and where to go if
      you want to install it and try it yourself.</p>

      <h2>What is Sass?</h2>
      <p>Sass stands for <strong>Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets</strong>. It is an extension of <a href="/css/css3.html">CSS3</a> that acts as
        a metalanguage and allows you to write your CSS rules using the logic and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) philosophy of programming. If you view the
      CSS source code from most websites, you'll find a long, ugly page of style rules with very little logic. Using Sass allows you to include
      programming elements such as variables and nesting in your style rules.</p>
