    <h2>Why Ruby?</h2>
  </header>
  <section>
    <p>There are many programming languages available to a new programmer. Some you may know: Java, C and Javascript. Some you may not know: Haskell, Lisp or SmallTalk.</p>

    <p>Ruby is flexible, popular, easy to code and free.</p>

    <h3>Flexible</h3>
    <p>Ruby can be used for most anything: web applications, system utilities or even games. It is not made to only do one thing.</p>
    <p>Any programmer can also alter Ruby. If needed functionality does not exist in Ruby, the programmer can add it.</p>
    <p>Ruby can be run from the command line, from a script or as a web application.</p>

    <h3>Popular</h3>
    <p>Ruby is one of the top ten most used programming languages. Ruby on Rails, introduced in 2003, allows for rapid development of web applications. Many well known sites use Rails: <a href="http://www.groupon.com" target="example">Groupon</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com" target="example">LinkedIn</a>, <a href="http://www.github.com" target="example">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://www.hulu.com" target="example">Hulu</a>, <a href="http://www.basecamp.com" target="example">Basecamp</a>, <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com" target="example">Penny Arcade</a> and others.</p>

    <p>Much of Ruby's popularity stems from it being easy to read and easy to code.</p>

    <h3>Easy to Read and Code</h3>

    <p>Ruby is written to appear as close to English as possible. It does not add more words or syntax to do something simple.</p>

    <p>If you want to have your computer show "Hello world!" on the screen, you would need to do the following...</p>

    <h4>In Java</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello world!");
  }
}
</pre>

    <p>Translated, this says:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Create a block of code that anyone can use to show <code>"Hello world!"</code>.</li>
    <li>In this block, there is a block of code, a function, that runs by default, called <code>main</code>, whenever someone tries to use <code>HelloWorld</code>.</li>
    <li>This function does not require additional information.</li>
    <li>This function runs a command, called a method.</li>
    <li>This method prints a line of text (<code>"Hello world!"</code>) out to the system (<code>System.out.println</code>).</li>
    </ol>
    <p><i>Whew.</i></p>

    <h4>In Ruby</h4>

<pre class="prettyprint linenums">
puts "Hello world!"
</pre>

    <p>This says put <code>"Hello world!"</code> on the screen.</p>

    <p>Which language would you rather learn?</p>

    <h3>Free</h3>

    <p>Ruby can be downloaded and installed at no cost. All you need to program with it is a text editor; no specialized programs (called Integrated Development Environments or IDEs) are required.</p>
